# Ideas

* implement self-play (most important thing to do!)
* besides Q-Learning consider standard Monte Carlo (easy to implement) and MCTS (harder to implement)
* implement after-state representation (see http://www.gm.fh-koeln.de/ciopwebpub/Kone15c.d/TR-TDgame_EN.pdf)
* implement perfect playing Minimax for statistics
* reward 0 if looses instead of -1
