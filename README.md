# Ideas

* test everything with 1'000'000 episodes -> overfitting around 500k episodes
* consider ellegibility traces
* consider using MCTS
* implement perfect playing Minimax for statistics

# ToDo

* improve statistics (!)
* implement minimax 2 as test statistic -> not necessary because 1 game with the frontend is enough to evaluate the performance
* research and implement decay scheme for learning_rate and epsilon

* set args in command line interface -> configuration in main class, no extra file and command line inputs necessary
